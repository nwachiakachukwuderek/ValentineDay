# VALENTINE REQUEST REACT APP❤️❤️
##### This an application i created to ask my crush to be my val 
## About the Project 
I struggle to open up but I'm quite romantic so I thought that code is a good way to express myself without being shy and to get all my word across. If you want a cute out of the ordinary way of telling someone how you feel(friend, crush, girlfriend, mom e.t.c) this VALENTINE, then look no further. 
it was made with simplicity in mind for but techies and non-techies to use.
