# VALENTINE REQUEST REACT APP❤️❤️
##### This an application i created to ask my crush to be my val 
## About the Project 
I struggle to open up but I'm quite romantic so I thought that code is a good way to express myself without being shy and to get all my word across. If you want a cute out of the ordinary way of telling someone how you feel(friend, crush, girlfriend, mom e.t.c) this VALENTINE, then look no further. 
it was made with simplicity in mind for but techies and non-techies to use.

## 🛠Tech Stack
* HTML and CSS: For the structure of the website and styling with little animation respectively 
* JavaScript: For the logic 
* React.js: Component-Based UI architecture 
* Netlify: Hosting and Automated Deployment 

## Usage
** ALL THE VARIABLES THAT NEED TO BE ADJUSTED ARE AT THE TOP OF App.Jsx **
* Edit Text: All variables and text are stored in a **config** object at the top of **App.jsx** simply remove the default text and add your own personalized message.

* Adjust Speed: Locate the **Base Speed** variable. A higher number makes the text move faster across the screen, while a lower number makes it slower.

* Change Music: 1. Paste your audio file into the **src/assets folder**.
2. Import the new file in **App.jsx**.
3. Update the **audioUrl** variable to point to your new file.
